<objective>
Create the welcome screen component that displays when the app first loads and no simulation has been run yet.

Purpose: Transform the empty dashboard state into a welcoming introduction that explains the Buy-Borrow-Die strategy and guides users to their first simulation.

Output: `WelcomeScreen` Web Component with BBD education content, benefits/risks, and CTA buttons.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create welcome-screen component</name>
  <files>src/components/ui/welcome-screen.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `WelcomeScreen` Web Component that extends `BaseComponent`.

**Template structure:**
1. Welcome hero section with title "Welcome to eVelo Portfolio Simulator" and subtitle
2. BBD Explanation section with three step cards:
   - Buy (icon: chart trending up) - "Purchase appreciating assets (stocks, real estate). Hold long-term to maximize growth."
   - Borrow (icon: bank) - "Access cash via securities-backed lines of credit (SBLOC). Loan proceeds are not taxable income."
   - Die (icon: scales of justice) - "Heirs inherit assets with stepped-up basis, potentially avoiding capital gains tax on appreciation."
3. Benefits/Risks grid:
   - Benefits: No capital gains tax on borrowed funds, portfolio continues compounding, stepped-up basis at death
   - Risks: Margin calls if portfolio drops, interest accrues on borrowed funds, forced liquidation in severe downturns, tax law changes
4. CTA Section with two buttons:
   - Primary: "Run Your First Simulation" (dispatches 'quick-start' event)
   - Secondary: "View User Guide" (dispatches 'show-guide' event)
5. Disclaimer section (yellow warning style): "This simulator is for educational purposes only. Consult qualified tax and financial advisors before implementing any tax strategy."

**Styling requirements:**
- Use CSS Grid for step cards (3-column on desktop, 1-column on mobile at 768px breakpoint)
- Step cards have light teal background (#f0fdfa), centered icon (using SVG not emoji), teal heading
- Benefits have green heading (#059669), Risks have amber heading (#f59e0b)
- Disclaimer has amber left border and light amber background
- Primary button uses --color-primary with white text
- Secondary button uses outlined style with primary color border
- Responsive: Stack CTAs vertically on mobile

**Event handling in afterRender:**
- Quick-start button: `dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('quick-start', { bubbles: true, composed: true }))`
- Learn More button: `dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('show-guide', { bubbles: true, composed: true }))`

**Public methods:**
- `show()`: Set display to block
- `hide()`: Set display to none

Use SVG icons for steps (not emoji) - use simple inline SVGs similar to param-section icons in app-root.

File exists at src/components/ui/welcome-screen.ts with:
- Class extends BaseComponent
- template() returns hero, BBD steps, benefits/risks, CTAs, disclaimer
- styles() includes responsive CSS with 768px breakpoint
- afterRender() sets up click handlers
- show() and hide() methods defined
- customElements.define('welcome-screen', WelcomeScreen) at bottom
  </verify>
  <done>
WelcomeScreen component renders BBD education content with visually distinct sections, clear CTAs, and disclaimer.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Export welcome-screen from barrel</name>
  <files>src/components/ui/index.ts</files>
  <action>
Add import for the new welcome-screen component to the UI barrel export file.

Add line: `import './welcome-screen';`

Place it alphabetically with other imports (after 'weight-editor' or at appropriate position).
  </action>
  <verify>
`grep "welcome-screen" src/components/ui/index.ts` shows the import line.
  </verify>
  <done>
WelcomeScreen component is auto-registered when UI components are imported.
  </done>
</task>

1. Build succeeds: `npm run build` completes without TypeScript errors
2. Component registered: Welcome-screen custom element is defined
3. Content accuracy: BBD explanation matches research (step-up basis "under current tax law", risks mentioned)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- WelcomeScreen component exists and exports correctly
- Template includes all required sections (hero, BBD steps, benefits/risks, CTAs, disclaimer)
- Styling is responsive with proper breakpoints
- Events dispatch correctly for quick-start and show-guide actions
- Build passes with no errors
</success_criteria>
