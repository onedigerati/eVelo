<objective>
Human verification of complete theme implementation across desktop and mobile views

Purpose: Automated testing cannot fully verify visual appearance and user experience. Human verification ensures the theme implementation works correctly for real users, catching any edge cases or visual issues missed by code review.

Output: Verified and approved theme implementation ready for production.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Verify theme implementation in desktop view</name>
  <what-built>
Complete theme infrastructure including:
1. Chart dataset color updates on theme toggle (Plan 01)
2. WCAG-compliant contrast ratios for all text (Plan 02)
3. Themed disabled states for form inputs (Plan 03)
4. Focus indicator visibility in both themes
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Desktop Verification Checklist:**

1. **Initial Load (Light Theme)**
   - Open http://localhost:5173 in fresh browser tab
   - Verify no FOUC (flash of unstyled content)
   - Confirm app loads in correct theme (light by default or last selected)

2. **Theme Toggle**
   - Click theme toggle in header
   - Verify entire UI updates smoothly (no flashing or partial updates)
   - Repeat toggle 2-3 times to verify consistency

3. **Chart Color Updates**
   - Run a simulation to display charts
   - Toggle theme while viewing results
   - Verify probability cone chart: percentile bands change colors
   - Verify histogram chart: bar colors update
   - Verify all other charts: lines, bars, areas all update
   - Check chart text (axis labels, legend) is readable in both themes

4. **Text Readability**
   - In light theme: verify all text is clearly readable
   - In dark theme: verify all text is clearly readable
   - Check secondary text (gray) is visible in both themes
   - Check error messages (red) are visible in both themes
   - Check success messages (green) are visible in both themes

5. **Form Inputs**
   - In sidebar, verify all form inputs are readable
   - Tab through form elements - verify focus indicators are visible
   - Check disabled inputs (if any) appear properly muted

6. **Modal Dialogs**
   - Open settings panel
   - Toggle theme while modal is open
   - Verify modal backdrop and content update correctly
   - Check modal text is readable

7. **Theme Persistence**
   - Set theme to dark
   - Refresh page (F5)
   - Verify app loads in dark theme (not flash to light then dark)
   - Set theme to light
   - Refresh page
   - Verify app loads in light theme

8. **System Theme Detection**
   - Set theme to "System" option (if available)
   - Change OS dark mode setting
   - Verify app responds to system preference change

**Report any issues found with specific details:**
- Component affected
- Theme where issue occurs
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshot if possible
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "desktop approved" if all checks pass, or describe issues found</resume-signal>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify theme implementation in mobile view</name>
  <what-built>
Same theme infrastructure as desktop, verified for mobile responsive behavior.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Mobile Verification Checklist:**

Use browser DevTools mobile emulation (iPhone 12/13 or similar) OR actual mobile device.

1. **Mobile Layout + Theme**
   - Open app in mobile viewport
   - Verify theme toggle is accessible (header or settings)
   - Toggle theme - verify entire mobile UI updates

2. **Sidebar in Both Themes**
   - Open sidebar panel
   - Verify sidebar background correct for each theme
   - Verify form inputs readable in both themes
   - Verify "eVelo Parameters" label styled correctly

3. **Charts on Mobile**
   - Run simulation
   - Scroll through dashboard charts
   - Toggle theme while viewing charts
   - Verify chart colors update on mobile
   - Verify chart text (small size) is readable

4. **Touch Interactions**
   - Tap form inputs - verify focus states work
   - Tap buttons - verify active/pressed states work
   - Scroll through content - verify no visual glitches

5. **Mobile-Specific Components**
   - Check sticky Run Simulation button styling in both themes
   - Check mobile comparison tabs (if in comparison mode)
   - Check mobile trade-off summary

**Report any mobile-specific issues:**
- Component affected
- Device/viewport size
- Theme where issue occurs
- Expected vs actual behavior
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "mobile approved" if all checks pass, or describe issues found</resume-signal>
